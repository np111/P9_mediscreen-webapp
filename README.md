## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine **for development**.

*Note: You should first run the
[java backend](https://github.com/np111/P9_mediscreen) (the easiest way is to
use docker-compose).*

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install [Yarn 1.0+](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

### Running webapp

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the development environment (with hot-reloading):

```bash
yarn run dev
```

### Testing

```bash
yarn run lint
yarn run test
```

## Deployment

Take a look at [nextjs.org/docs/deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
